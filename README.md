# Meshtastic
 Meshtastic devices can help explorers stay connected, share locations, send emergency distress signals, etc. in remote mountainous areas without mobile phone signals during outdoor activities such as hiking and mountaineering. In some small communities or remote villages, Meshtastic mesh networks can be built to meet local communication needs, such as community notifications and emergency warnings. In the event that natural disasters (such as earthquakes and floods) damage traditional communication infrastructure, Meshtastic devices can be quickly deployed to establish emergency communication networks to provide communication means for rescue workers and disaster victims.
